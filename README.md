# 👨🏻‍💻 Isaac Machado

**`Data and Business Analyst`**

Business Administration graduate from Insper (2023), with a technical background in IT from IFES. Since 2022, I have been working at the intersection of financial and operational data, developing a strong analytical mindset combined with technical expertise in financial statements (P&L, Cash Flow, Balance Sheet), operational KPIs, and firmographic data — with a special focus on the consumer and retail sectors.

My recent experiences include roles in data-driven teams focused on strategy support and opportunity identification through analytics. I frequently use SQL for querying and data exploration, along with Python and R (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels) for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. Techniques I’ve implemented include clustering (K-Means), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and supervised learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost for forecasting and segmentation.

I also have strong experience in Data Storytelling using Power BI and Looker, creating interactive dashboards that merge quantitative and qualitative insights — always focused on solving business problems, communicating clearly, and collaborating effectively.

This path has been shaped by experiences at companies such as Santander, IGC Partners (a leading M&A boutique in LatAm), and in the FP&A team at Isaac Educação (a Brazilian Edtech), where I’ve consistently contributed to data-informed decision-making.

Curious by nature, passionate about solving complex problems, and constantly seeking to connect business and data with clarity and impact.
